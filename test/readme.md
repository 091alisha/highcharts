# Test runner

Use `npm test` to run the tests using karma and QUnit. All tests in the `samples/unit-tests`
directory will run. For debugging, it may be convenient to use the
[visual test tools](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/utils).

Tests will run on _pre-commit_ and will block committing in case of failure.

#### Troubleshooting
- All the Highcharts files, including modules and indicators, are loaded in the
  test runner. A badly written module can cause errors downstream. If you
  can't pinpoint an error, try removing files from `test/karma-files.json`.
- Similar to the above, all tests run in the same thread, so a badly written 
  test may cause errors downstream. Try limiting the number of tests that run
  by modifying the glob in the `files` config in `tests/karma-config.js`.
- Traditionally, the Highcharts unit tests have a `demo.html` file where the
  tests in `demo.js` run. In karma/QUnit, the `demo.html` file is not included.
  If the test depends on things like the width of the container or other DOM 
  elements, this must be set up by JavaScript in `demo.js`. A fixed size chart
  is better defined with the `chart.width` option.
- Don't use global variables. ESLint should raise an error on this on pre-commit.
  If several of the tests in the same `demo.js` share a function or variables,
  wrap it all in an IIFE.
- All the tests run on one Highcharts instance. When running `Highcharts.setOptions()`,
  make sure to unset the changed options, otherwise it may break tests
  downstream.
