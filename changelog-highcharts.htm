<p>Highcharts 5.0.3 (2016-11-18)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added new option, <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/lang.numericSymbolMagnitude">lang.numericSymbolMagnitude</a>, to support numeric symbol shortening in Japanese, Korean and certain Chinese locales.</li>
    <li>Added new option, <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.solidgauge.threshold">threshold</a>, for solid gauge series.</li>
    <li>Added new CSS custom property, <code>textOutline</code>, and at the same time removed the <code>textShadow</code> shim. Closes <a href="https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/5849">#5849</a>.</li>
    <li>Better implementation of the <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.pinchType">chart.pinchType</a> option. Allow <code>pinchType</code> and <code>zoomType</code> to be set independently. When <code>tooltip.followTouchMove</code> is true, pinchType only applies to two-finger touches. Closes <a href="https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/5840">#5840</a>.</li>
    <li>Changed the <code>Highcharts.addEvent</code> function to return a callback to be used to remove the same event.</li>
    <li>Implemented bubbles in the Boost module.</li>
    <li>Improved alignment of ticks on multiple axes by allowing ticks to be placed at less strict intervals.</li>
    <li>Refactored split tooltip connectors to use common callback shape instead.</li>
