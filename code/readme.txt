WHAT FILES TO USE
- The files for classic mode are available on root.
- The JavaScript files for styled mode are available under the /js/ folder. In these files, most presentational code is removed, so without styling it will draw an ugly black-and-white chart if anything.
- The default CSS file for styled mode is available as /css/highcharts.css on the root of code.highcharts.com as well as under version folders. This CSS is in turn based on a SCSS file, highcharts.scss. To experiment with this live, see our example with SCSS parsing on Codepen.
